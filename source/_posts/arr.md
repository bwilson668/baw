# ARR vs. ARR

Why do you have to be so confusing?  
*ARR* translates to *Annual Run Rate*, which is your MRR * 12.  
**ARR** translates to **Annual Recurring Revenue**, which measures how much recurring revenue you had in the last 12 months.

The first is a forward projection off a one month snapshot of MRR. The second is a summation of the last 12 months of actual performance.  
Yet, they both get called ARR. 

I prefer the **Annual Recurring Revenue** definition. It is actual performance.

I understand *Annual Run Rate* is used as a gauge for how the company should perform over the next year. It's not a good proxy for actual performance.  
If we take off our rose colored glasses.

Churn has been called the "silent killer", so why would you project 12 months assuming 0% churn!
