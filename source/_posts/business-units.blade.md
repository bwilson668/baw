## Types of Recurring Revenue

Every company needs to make repeated sales to stay in business over time. Some business models are easier than others to know where the next sale is coming from.

On one end of the spectrum you have purely one-time transactional engagements. This could be like deciding to purchase a Snickers, or a struggling freelancer willing to take any new project. This can be executed well. *[Good Example here]*

On the other end of the spectrum you have ongoing relationships with customers that are setup to automatically pay again next month or next time they use the service. SaaS companies can typically count 95%+ of their current months revenue as in the bank for next month.

In John Warrillow's book, [Built to Sell](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823/), he lays out six types of recurring revenue from least valuable to most valuable.

1. Consumables
2. Sunk Money Consumables
3. Renewable Subscriptions
4. Sunk Money Renewable Subscriptions
5. Auto-Renewal Subscriptions
6. Contracts

In his follow-up book, [The Automatic Customer](https://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Customer-Creating-Subscription-Business/dp/159184746X), he outlines 9 subscription models.

1. Membership sites
2. All-you-can-eat library
3. Private Club
4. Front-of-the-line
5. Consumables
6. Surprise Box
