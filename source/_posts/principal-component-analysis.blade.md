Think back to your teenage hooligan days. Your parents are out of town, you throw an **EPIC** party. Now it is just a matter of not being caught. You have to clean up everything in the home just like you found it.

This is the story of my old friend, who if he had included just a few more Principal Components, he would've been off scot-free!

Think of a perfectly placed picture hung on the wall. You take it down for the party just for safe keeping.  
After the party you go to hang it up and your brother is there to talk you through the placement.

First he says, "That picture belongs on that wall over there."  
He continues, "It was on the top hook."  
Now the changes get more precise.  
"Shift it to the left."  
"No, a smidge back to the right."  
"Why is it sagging so much? Tighten the cord a bit."  
"Ooh... it's still uneven. Twist the right side up a little."  

These adjustments can continue forever! You decide to move on because there are other pictures to hang, pillows to place, and holes to patch.

The picture is not hung perfectly where it was before, but you hope it's close enough to be believable.

This is the trade-off for Principal Components -- speed for accuracy.  
It is up to the analyst to decide how close is "close enough".

Transition into the math behind it and the sample code.

Look at `GT > Intro to Data Modeling > Week 4 HW > Ex. 9.1` for an example.
