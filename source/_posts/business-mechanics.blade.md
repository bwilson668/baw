description: Business change over time. If you understand the mechanics, you can direct the change.

I have been fascinated with how things change over time. A business certainly changes over time, but it is not something you can physically observe. There is a way to instrument a business to highlight the changes.

Changes over time are very important to As-A-Service companies. The model works by making an upfront investment in a new customer and it only pays off if you keep that partnership long term.

I am still working on finding the right name for the idea, but a business should abide by some laws of "physics". Since our business is not physical, these laws will manifest themselves in math. Still, we will take our inspiration from physics!

- *Mechanics* - The study of motion.
- *Kinematics* - The subset of Mechanics that describes motion.
- *Dynamics* - The subset of Mechanics that studies the cause of motion.

What are some different "motions" that your business takes?

- *Cash Flow* - How is the money coming in and going out?
  - This is the big one. The life-blood of your business. It is smart to break this down into smaller sections.
- *Lead Generation* - How do you attract new or repeat customers? Typically the domain of marketing.
- *Sales*
- *Account Management / Customer Success*
- *Onboarding* - What is the first experience with your product or service like?
- *Logisitics / Procurement* - What needs to get where and when?

Now that you have identified the areas where your business changes and how it rolls up to the big picture, what visibility do you have into those areas?
Can you describe the motion they go through? What are the *kinematics* of that process?

This is where good clean data comes in!
It is like putting dye in a wind tunnel. You can all the sudden see how an invisible force behaves.

**TODO: Find a good video to go here - Maybe the truck that gets air caught in it's truckbed?**

Once you understand the behavior, you can begin to experiment with the *dynamics*.
If we change **this**, how does it change **that**?

Slowly but surely, you'll uncover the levers you can pull in your business.
