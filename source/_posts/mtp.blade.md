MTP stands for Massive Transformative Purpose.

**TODO: Link to Peter Diamandis**

Is helping businesses be more efficient just helping the rich get richer?

No. Self-employeed statistic. America is by nature an entreprenurial country.

Even if you are not in America, running a business is great. You take responsibility for yourself, the people you hire, and the people you serve.

I believe that more people creating businesses is a good thing. I want to bring down the barrier to starting a successful business.
